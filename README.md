# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository contains code and report for my Kaggle Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project which entailed the development of Machine Learning models, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, to accurately forecast customer churn and profitability for a telecommunications company.

**Executive Summary**

This project focused on addressing customer churn in a telecom company by developing a logistic 
regression model and implementing customer segmentation using a decision tree. The logistic 
regression model successfully predicted customer churn, allowing the company to take proactive 
measures to retain customers and reduce churn rates. By analyzing customer data and identifying 
key characteristics associated with churn, customer segmentation provided valuable insights for 
targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
Furthermore, the project evaluated the performance of the logistic regression model and decision 
tree predictions through various metrics, including the calculation of expected profit for churners. 
This analysis provided a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of the models and their 
potential impact on the company's profitability.
The findings of this project emphasize the importance of proactive customer retention strategies 
based on the logistic regression model's predictions. By identifying customers at high risk of churn, 
the company can implement personalized offers, improved customer support, and tailored marketing 
campaigns to enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn rates.
Additionally, the customer segmentation derived from the decision tree analysis enables the 
company to understand different customer groups and their unique characteristics. This information 
can guide the development of targeted marketing initiatives, customized service offerings, and 
tailored communication strategies to meet the specific needs and preferences of each customer 
segment.
Overall, this project provides actionable insights and recommendations for the telecom company to 
mitigate customer churn, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth. By leveraging 
the predictive power of the logistic regression model and customer segmentation, the company can 
optimize its resources and strategies to retain valuable customers, enhance profitability, and foster 
long-term customer relationships.
