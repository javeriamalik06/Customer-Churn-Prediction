# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This repository contains code and report for my Kaggle Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project which entailed the development of Machine Learning models, including Logistic Regression and Decision Trees, to accurately forecast customer churn and profitability for a telecommunications company.
I, along with my team members, cleaned the data, explored it, build models; logistic regression and decision tree and compared the models to use the model with better performance and did customer segmentation and calculated profitability of the model.
